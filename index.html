    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science student at High Point University, driven by a
      passion for coding, game design, and continuous learning. With three years
      of diverse work experience. I have developed strong interpersonal skills,
      effective communication, and a knack for conflict resolution across
      multiple roles. Combining my technical skills and creativity, I leverage
      my academic foundation in Computer Science and Game Design to deliver
      innovative, high-quality products and experiences. I excel in coding, team
      collaboration, and project execution, and I bring unique ideas to life
      through teamwork and attention to detail. I thrive in dynamic
      environments, enjoy working with cross-functional teams, and am dedicated
      to staying at the forefront of programming and game development. I am
      excited about opportunities to contribute, grow, and connect with
      like-minded professionals.
